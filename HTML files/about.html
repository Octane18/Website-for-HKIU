            Welcome to Hong Kong Industrial University -- a dynamic and innovative institution committed to providing high-quality education and 
            research opportunities for students from Hong Kong and worldwide. Since our establishment in 1997, we have been dedicated to becoming a
            small-scale, high-level, and international university oriented toward research and innovation.

        </p>
        <p>
            Our campus covers an area of approximately 500 hectares. It is located in the Hong Kong Kowloon High-Tech Park, where we collaborate
            closely with institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Our faculty comprises renowned scholars and experts from home and abroad 
            who are committed to providing students with cutting-edge knowledge and skills in 11 disciplines, including Physics, Chemistry, Biology, 
            Materials Science and Engineering, Electronic Science and Technology, Cognitive Science, Computer Science and Technology, Biomedical Engineering, 
            Electronics and Information Technology, Materials, and Chemical Engineering, and Biology and Medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Hong Kong Industrial University, we offer a student-centered educational approach that encourages cross-disciplinary research in an international 
            environment. Our curriculum is based on international standards and is taught entirely in English. We encourage undergraduate students to join research 
            groups from their first year, with approximately 82% of our undergraduate students joining research groups by their third year and 100% by their final year. 
            To broaden our students' international perspectives, we provide them various overseas study opportunities, including at world-renowned universities such as 
            Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University, City University of Hong Kong, and Peking University.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our faculty members are recognized leaders in their fields, with 321 tenured professors and 80% with overseas study or work experience. As a university committed 
            to innovation, we have created an atmosphere on campus that supports and encourages entrepreneurship. We have established 370 spin-off companies, with 114 of them 
            founded in 2024 alone. Our incubator programs provide students and faculty opportunities to connect with technology, market, policy, and capital resources, making 
            it a crucial "power source" for innovation practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hong Kong Industrial University's strength lies in our world-class facilities and talented faculty and students. We are dedicated to providing our students with the
